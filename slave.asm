; Assembly snippet for N76E003 configured as an I2C slave

ORG 0000H ; Start of program

; I2C Slave Initialization
MOV A, #SLAVE_ADDR ; Load your I2C slave address into accumulator
MOV I2ADDR, A      ; Set the I2C slave address register
SETB I2CEN         ; Enable I2C function by setting the I2CEN bit in I2CON register
SETB AA            ; Enable acknowledgment to respond to I2C master

; Main loop
MAIN_LOOP:
JNB SI, $          ; Wait for the SI flag to be set indicating an I2C event

; Read the I2C status register to determine the cause of the interrupt
MOV A, I2STAT
CJNE A, #STATUS_SLAW, CHECK_READ ; Check if we've received our slave address + write bit
SJMP HANDLE_WRITE                ; Handle the write operation

CHECK_READ:
CJNE A, #STATUS_SLAR, MAIN_LOOP  ; Check if we've received our slave address + read bit
SJMP HANDLE_READ                 ; Handle the read operation

; Handle Write Operation
HANDLE_WRITE:
; Code to receive and process data from the master goes here
; After processing data, clear SI to wait for the next operation
CLR SI
SJMP MAIN_LOOP

; Handle Read Operation
HANDLE_READ:
; Code to send data to the master goes here
; Load data to I2DAT, clear SI, and wait for next operation
MOV I2DAT, A       ; Assuming A register contains data to send
CLR SI
SJMP MAIN_LOOP

; Error Handler and Miscellaneous
ERROR_HANDLER:
; Code to handle any errors or unexpected states
CLR SI             ; Ensure SI is cleared before continuing
SJMP MAIN_LOOP

END

; Definitions and status codes
SLAVE_ADDR EQU 0x50 ; Example slave address, adjust as needed
STATUS_SLAW EQU 0x60 ; Status code for SLA+W received and ACK returned
STATUS_SLAR EQU 0x68 ; Status code for SLA+R received and ACK returned
