; I2C Slave Initialization
MOV A, #SLAVE_ADDR ; Load your I2C slave address into accumulator
MOV I2ADDR, A      ; Set the I2C slave address register
SETB I2CEN         ; Enable I2C function by setting the I2CEN bit in I2CON register
SETB AA            ; Enable acknowledgment to respond to I2C master

; Main loop
MAIN_LOOP:
JNB SI, $          ; Wait for the SI flag to be set indicating an I2C event
; (STA,STO,SI,AA) = (1,0,0,X) -> don't need to adjust any of these values? read only?
; case (I2STAT)
; 00H -> error
; 08H -> START transmitted, clear STA, load SLA+W/R: I2DAT = SLA_ADDR1
; 10H -> Repeated START transmitted, clear STA, I2DAT = SLA_ADDR2 (i guess this won't be used with only one slave)
; 40H -> SLA+R transmitted, acknowledged: AA = 1
; 48H -> SLA+R transmitted, not acknowledged, STO = 1, AA = 1
; 50H -> Data recieved, acknowledged, store recieved data: datain = I2DAT. 
; 58H -> Data recieved, not acknowledged, store recieved data: datain = I2DAT, STO = 1, AA = 1

; From diagram 15.9 Flow and Status of Slave Reciever Node
; case (I2STAT)
; 60H -> SLA+W has been recieved and ACK has been transmitted. I2DAT = SLA+W (of slave)
; 80H -> data byte has been recieved, ACK transmitted. I2DAT = data byte
; 88H -> data byte recieved, ACK transmitted, I2DAT = data byte
; A0H -> STOP or repeated START has been recieved
; I2STAT should be 60 or 68 regardless
