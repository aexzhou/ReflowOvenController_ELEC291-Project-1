; Assembly snippet for initializing the I2C module and generating a start condition on N76E003

ORG 0000H ; Start of program

; I2C Initialization
; Assuming SYSCLK is set up and running at your desired system clock frequency

; Set I2C Clock Rate for 100kHz assuming a 16MHz system clock
; Formula: I2C Clock Rate = SYSCLK / (4 * (I2CLK + 1))
; To get a 100kHz I2C clock, I2CLK = (SYSCLK / (4 * 100kHz)) - 1
; For SYSCLK = 16MHz, I2CLK = (16,000,000 / (4 * 100,000)) - 1 = 39
MOV A, #39          ; Load the value 39 into Accumulator for 100kHz I2C clock rate
MOV I2CLK, A        ; Set the I2C clock rate

; Enable I2C Module
SETB I2CEN          ; Set the I2CEN bit in I2CON register to enable I2C module

; Generate Start Condition
SETB STA            ; Set the STA bit in I2CON to generate a start condition
JNB SI, $           ; Wait for the SI flag to be set, indicating the start condition has been transmitted
CLR SI              ; Clear SI flag to proceed with the next operation

; Now the I2C module is initialized, and a start condition has been generated.
; The next steps would typically involve sending the slave address and the R/W bit,
; followed by the data byte(s) and then generating a stop condition.

; Assembly snippet for reading data from a slave device using I2C on N76E003

; Send Slave Address with Read Bit
MOV A, #((EEPROM_SLA<<1) | 0x01) ; EEPROM_SLA should be the slave address. Left shift and add read bit (1)
MOV I2DAT, A                    ; Load the slave address with read bit into I2DAT register
CLR SI                          ; Clear SI flag to initiate the address transmission
JNB SI, $                       ; Wait for the SI flag to be set, indicating the end of the operation

; Check if Slave Acknowledged the Address
MOV A, I2STAT                   ; Load the status register into the accumulator
CJNE A, #0x40, ERROR_HANDLER    ; Compare it with the status code for ACK received after SLA+R transmitted
                                ; Jump to error handler if not matched

; Set to Receive Data with ACK for continuous reading or NACK for a single byte
SETB AA                         ; Set the AA bit for acknowledging the received data
CLR SI                          ; Clear SI flag to initiate the receive operation
JNB SI, $                       ; Wait for the SI flag to be set, indicating data reception

; Read the received data from the I2DAT register
MOV A, I2DAT                    ; Move the received data into the accumulator

; Prepare to send NACK after last byte if it's a single byte read operation
CLR AA                          ; Clear the AA bit to send NACK after receiving the next byte
CLR SI                          ; Clear SI flag to complete the operation
JNB SI, $                       ; Wait for SI flag, indicating the end of byte reception

; Generate Stop Condition to end communication
SETB STO                        ; Set the STO bit to generate a stop condition
JNB STO, $                      ; Wait for the hardware to clear STO, indicating the stop condition has been transmitted
